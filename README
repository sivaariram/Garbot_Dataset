# Garbage-Dataset
The data-set’s original images were captured in theUniversity of Oulu warehouse in summer 2019, it has variety of viewpoints. To support in the reproduciblity of image clas-sification and target recognition we have collected, labelled,generated  the  images  in  the  Fire  simulator  and  ball(FSB)data-set
